# Introduction

> This is a Vue.js project which is built using vue-cli. It is a simple application which makes calls to a backend microservice (personal-expense-calculator) and retrieves data for a particular user's monthly expenses and displays it in beautiful charts. Highcharts have been used for this implementation.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
